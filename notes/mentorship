Hi Chris,

I've done the titanic project and I found it really cool. I started using IPython before knowing what a jupter notebook was, and I was really impressed. Neat.
I algo got some good feedback from the reviewers.

Now, I just completed the Statistical Analysis section and, to be honest, I felt disapointed with most of the ML/coding parts; they were very superficial and the practical side was simple copying and pasting exerises.
The only good bits were the ones used on the Intro to ML course; those felt realy solid.
The statistical were ok, as a refresher.

Will start the final project tomorrow.

Are you able to watch my progress? Can you see which parts of the course I'v ecopleted? What about the projects?
